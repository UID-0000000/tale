Crossroads Suicides often occur at a certain crossroads. I was walking with a friend and I wanted to pass by there, but he was in a hurry, covered my eyes and took me to another road. Later, out of curiosity, I went there and witnessed four strange deaths: first, a man wearing a mask whose head was torn off; then a man with a blood-red patch on his face, which was horribly corroded; and then two men, who had been torn in half by a large knife, vertically, back and forth. The people on the side of the road didn't even notice it, so I told a nearby shopkeeper about it, and as we talked into the night, she suddenly rushed toward me, and I didn't hesitate to start running. When I got to the intersection, I saw another knife on the ground, and I turned my head and stabbed her, killing her. Then my vision suddenly turned blood red, and I saw a pile of corpses at the intersection, and the area around them was already red with blood.
